HIG Implementation (be more indepth and specific):

For my implementation of HIG, I started by first revising the font sizes in the index, houses, and spells files. Specifically for the titles, headers, and cardText's to ensure they are visible and readable. I also increased the padding of the cards to accommodate the larger font sizes. On the index page, I added additional touch padding for the “Are you a Wizard?” button to make it was easier to interact with. Finally, I increased the size of the tab buttons, I added more padding and height to the buttons, and icons to visualize the files topics.
